# Web3_Aficionados_Blockchain_Workshop
An introduction to blockchain development by Web3 Aficionados.

Hereâ€™s a lecture that would teach you the basics of Javascript. This is the most important programming language for blockchain developers, so it's important to get a hang of every basic concept before moving on to more complex concepts and framework.

A good knowledge of these basics will enhance your understanding of React.js, Express.js, Web.js and Node.js which will be covered later in this course.

The following concepts will be covered:

1. Variables
2. Data types
3. Operators and Equality
4. Logic and Control flow
5. Functions


Tools we will need to install:

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Google Chrome


Step 1

Create a folder named "Javascript".

Open your terminal, navigate into the Javascript folder and open VScode( code . ).

Create a script.js file and type:

console.log("hello world");

Create index.html file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<body>
   <script src="script.js"></script>
